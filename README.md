# YhjFrontend

This is the front end for the project https://github.com/jgrittonbell/YourHealthJournal.

_Please visit the above repository for the full readme._

Currently this is not hosted anywhere but I plan to get a server with more information about me and hosting my various projects soon!

I created this frontend to demonstrate the functionality of the YourHealthJournal API. Other front end options could be used but I chose angular because of the rich libraries available as well as the stability and continual support from it's developers.

If you would like to run this you will also have to run the backend Java API and the basic info to run angular is below.

# Angular Info:

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
